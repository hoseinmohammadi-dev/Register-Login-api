# Register & Login Page (Group Project)

This project is a simple Register/Login system built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, connected to a [MockAPI](https://mockapi.io/) backend for user data storage.  
It allows users to register, login, view their profile, and manage account actions such as edit or delete.
